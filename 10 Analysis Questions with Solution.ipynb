    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the mentoring program with Thabor Walbeek, the team has worked on 10 questions to analyze the COVID-19 data set. This notebook describes the questions, the results, and mostly the way to analyze, things to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "****\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1: Which 2 countries have the absolute maximum number of new cases on 30th March 2020?**\n",
    "\n",
    "****\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question already has a few things to keep in mind while analyzing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are looking for 2 countries only\n",
    "2. We need an absolute number (the non-negative value of a real number without regard to its sign)\n",
    "3. We need the maximum number of new cases\n",
    "4. For comparison we need to find the number of new cases on 30th March only\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **<span style=\"color:blue\">SOLUTION:</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our data set the data is cumulative until the last day recorded. As the date are in columns it's difficult to work with, hence if we unpivot the date - where we add the date as 1 column only - and all the different dates as rows instead of columns, we get the cumulative numbers in rows only. We can now extract each day with the previous day to get the (absolute) new cases per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are almost there! If we group the data per country (as some have multiple rows for different regions/provinces, we get the total new cases per day per country. \n",
    "Then from here we filter the data on 30 March 2020 only, and sort the data in descending order based on new cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "From that we will see that the answer to the question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. US\n",
    "2. Spain\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Q1.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **<span style=\"color:blue\">PITFALLS:</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "While answering this question, you have to take a few things in consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data set has cumulative data, which means it has the total number of new cases from the bgeinning of the data set until the specific date. To get the exact number of **new** cases per day, you have to extract the value with the value of the previous day.\n",
    "- The data set contains countries, but also a column for province/state/region. So make sure to aggregate on country level, to get the sum of all values per country.\n",
    "\n",
    "****\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Which 2 countries have the relative maximum number of new cases on 30th March 2020?**\n",
    "\n",
    "****\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question has a few things to keep in mind while analyzing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are looking for 2 countries only\n",
    "2. We need an relative number, which means the % change compared with the day prior to the respective date\n",
    "3. We need the maximum number of new cases\n",
    "4. For comparison we need to find the number of new cases on 30th March only\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **<span style=\"color:blue\">SOLUTION:</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tricky question, as we need to find a relative change. The main idea of this question is to find those countries that have a sudden high increase of new cases compared to the previuous day. As we have seen in Q1, the obvious countries that we see every day in the news appear, however, looking at the relative growth in 1 day, we can see that different countries pop up. Those might not be direct ly be the countries you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for the solution of this question we need to compare the new cases (not the cumulative values) per day per country. Then we need to use the following formula to calculate the % change relative to the previous day. \n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\Large X = \\frac{(y_{today}-y_{prev})}{y_{prev}}$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ,where \n",
    ">\n",
    "> X = relative growth\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $y_{today}$ = Cases totday (30th March)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $y_{prev}$ = Cases yesterday or previous day (29th March)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we exclude the error values (inf, NaN, N/A, etc.). From there we find:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Guinea-Bissau\n",
    "2. Saint Kitts and Nevis\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> UPDATE: THE INITIAL QUESTION WAS FROM 0 TO 1000 CASES, THIS HAS BEEN UPDATED TO 1 TO 1000 CASES\n",
    "\n",
    "The third question has a few things to keep in mind while analyzing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We only have to look at all countries that have more than 5000 cases total\n",
    "2. We need to know which was the first day of the first case\n",
    "3. We need to know which date was the first date the country got 1000 cases\n",
    "4. We have to calculate the difference between 2 and 3\n",
    "5. Then we take an average of all outcomes of 4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **<span style=\"color:blue\">SOLUTION:</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution for this question involves multiple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First unpivot the data set, so the dates are mentioned in rows instead of columns\n",
    "2. Group the data per country, but keep all dates\n",
    "3. Find the date where the number of cases is > 1 for the first time (the first date a new case is registered)\n",
    "4. find the date where the cumulative number of cases is >1000 (the first date where there are 1000 or more cases registered)\n",
    "5. Keep those 2 columns and group by country to get the aggregated values\n",
    "6. Filter only those countries that have a total number of cases of > 5000\n",
    "7. Take the date difference between step 4 and 3\n",
    "8. Calculate the average value of step 7\n",
