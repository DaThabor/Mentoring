On many public sites dashboards, analysis and notebooks can be found. \n\nFor those new to the analysis, this notebook will guide them through some basic steps to start an exploratory analysis on available data sets and gain their first insights.\n\nThe notebook will follow simple step-by-step guidance in retrieving the data sets and understand what is important when starting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In between questions are being asked to fully understand the reasons for executing those steps and gaining a good understanding on what is important on looking at data.\n\nIf you're not familair with tools like R or Python, don't worry. You can easily download the files (data sets) to your local machine and do similar actions in tools like MS Excel. Where possible examples will be given how to perform the same actions in MS Excel.\n\n-------------\n\nBefore starting any analysis it's important to understand what kind of data we are looking at. This means that we first need to go through some additional information. In our analysis we will be looking at the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Therefore we need to first understand what this virus is, and how data is populated.\n\n**Read the information following these links before continuining:**\n\n[WHO definition of COVID-19 virus: Get more understanding of what the COVID-19 virus is](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1)\n\n\n**Data sets used in this analysis can be found on Github:**\n\n[CSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)\n<br>\n2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE\nThis dataset is updated on daily basis by Johns Hopkins CSSE\n\n-----------------\n\nThe best way to start analyzing data is to follow this notebook chapter by chapter. That will help in understanding all steps of the analysis, but if you want to go back to another chapter use the Table of Content to easily skip to another section\n\n# Table of Content\n\n* [1.
